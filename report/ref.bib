abstract="The classical Particle Swarm Optimization is a powerful method to find the minimum of a numerical function, on a continuous definition domain. As some binary versions have already successfully been used, it seems quite natural to try to define a framework for a discrete PSO. In order to better understand both the power and the limits of this approach, we examine in detail how it can be used to solve the well known Traveling Salesman Problem, which is in principle very ``bad'' for this kind of optimization heuristic. Results show Discrete PSO is certainly not as powerful as some specific algorithms, but, on the other hand, it can easily be modified for any discrete/combinatorial problem for which we have no good specialized algorithm.",

abstract="Topological sort referred to as topo sort or topological ordering is defined as constraint-based ordering of nodes (vertices) of graph G or DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). In other words, it gives a linearized order of graph nodes describing the relationship between the graph vertices. Many applications of various fields in computer science require a constraint-based ordering of tasks and, thus, topological sorting holds a big place of importance for many applications like semantic analysis in compiler design, Gantt chart generation in software project management and many more. In this paper, a parallel version of this ordering algorithm over CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) has been discussed by identifying an approach to process-independent portions of the graph simultaneously for load flow analysis over radial distribution networks. The serial implementation of topological sort has been first discussed followed by its implementation on thread-block architecture of CUDA modifying the serial algorithm. Finally, the efficiency of this parallel version of topo sort has been investigated on various structures of graph modeled from radial distribution networks and has been reported.",

The objective of  minimizing the area and interconnect length would scale down the size of integrated chips. To meet the above objective, it is necessary to find an optimal solution for physical design components like partitioning, floorplanning, placement, and routing. This work helps to perform the optimization of the benchmark circuits with the above said components of physical design using hierarchical approach of evolutionary algorithms. The goal of  minimizing the delay in partitioning, minimizing the silicon area in floorplanning, minimizing the layout area in placement, minimizing the wirelength in routing  has indefinite influence on other criteria like power, clock, speed, cost, and so forth. Hybrid evolutionary algorithm is applied on each of its phases to achieve the objective. Because evolutionary algorithm that includes one or many local search steps within its evolutionary cycles to obtain the minimization of area and interconnect length. This approach combines a hierarchical design like genetic algorithm and simulated annealing to attain the objective. This hybrid approach can quickly produce optimal solutions for the popular benchmarks.}, journal={Mathematical Problems in Engineering}, publisher={Hindawi Publishing Corporation}, author={Shanavas, I.
